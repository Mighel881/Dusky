# Dusky - Give your device a duskier Look!

Stock iOS includes a Reduced Transparency Option which reduces the transparency/blur throughout the OS & looks pretty neat. This tweak lets you selectively apply this option to SpringBoard Components. Currently supported elements are :

Notifications
Widgets
Lockscreen Media Player
Folder Background
Dock
You can also choose to set custom corner radius to further refine the appearance.
